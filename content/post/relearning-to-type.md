## The Why?
More than 99% of the computer users use the QWERTY layout. You may be surprised to know that QWERTY layout was introduced in 1878.
Yes, it's not a typo. It's 1878! The 19th century. Queen Victoria was on the throne (with more than 20 years left).
<br/>
computers were not in existence yet!
<br/>
Man, forget about computers,<br/>
people were still horse-riding since they had no cars.

Look at your shiny QWERTY keyboard lying beneath your hands. You are looking at a layout more than 140 year old.
If you didn't fall off the chair yet, wait for the 2nd shaking fact to throw you to the floor:
_"The QWERTY layout has been designed intentionally to make people type slower."_

![Vintage QWERTY][Vintage QWERTY]

It's not a 1st of April joke. That's sincerely the truth. Almost any the computer user is typing with a layout where the characters are arranged
in order make him/her type slower.<br/>

The reason for that:
TBD ....

I don't know how to calculate the accumulated worldwide productivity loss here, but it's undoubtedly quite substantial.


## The When?
Recently I've read a book called [Ultralearning][Ultralearning Book Site]

About one year ago I've coincidentally came across a relatively new keyboard layout called [Colemak][Colemak Site].
I've always known there were more keyboards layout besides [QWERTY][QWERTY] being used.
I even knew that the 2nd most popular QWERTY alternative to QWERTY was [Dvorak][Dvorak].
However, I never found a good excuse to try to learn a new keyboard layout. In order to go for it I had to have a good incentive.

After doing some research about Colemak it felt like a different story, and the central reason is that
**Colemak has only 17 moved keys in comparison to QWERTY!**

That fact, at least I thought so, meant it will be very easy to learn Colemak.

From Colemak official site:
"_ Your fingers on QWERTY move 2.2x more than on Colemak.
QWERTY has 16x more same hand row jumping than Colemak. There are 35x more words you can type using only the home row on Colemak._

So I've decided I'd go for it. But that I don't want to go cold-turkey. I wanted a more gradual process.


## The How?
The plan I came up with was to practice Colemak a couple of minutes on a daily basis and when I'll feel ready I'll do the swap.

I've Googled for a Typing Training app with Colemak support and found [Type Fu][Type Fu].
I highly recommend this app. I've started working through the lesson. Each lesson adds a new keyboard character.

After a period of 9 months, practicing on-and-off it suddenly struck me that my QWERTY typing started to deteriorate.
The problem was that I wasn't yet fluent with Colemak. You could imagine how frustrating this can feel.
