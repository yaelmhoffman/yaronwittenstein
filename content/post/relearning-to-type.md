## The Why?
More than 99% of the computer users use the QWERTY layout, bud did you know that the QWERTY layout was introduced in 1878?
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it's not a typo. It's **1878**! The 19th century.
<br/>
Queen Victoria was on the throne (with more than 20 years left).
<br/>
Computers were not in existence yet!
<br/>
People didn't have home electricity!!
<br/>
Man, forget about home-electricity and computers,<br/>
People were still horse-riding since they had no cars.

Look at your shiny QWERTY keyboard lying beneath your hands. You are looking at a layout of more than 140 year old!
<br/><br/>
If you didn't fall off the chair yet, wait for the 2nd shaking fact to throw you to the floor:
<br/>
_**"The QWERTY layout has been designed intentionally to make people type slower."**_

![QWERTY Vintage][QWERTY Vintage]

It's not a April Fools' Day joke. That's sincerely the truth. Almost any computer user is typing with a layout where the characters are arranged
in order make him/her type slower.<br/>

The reason for that:
TBD ....

I don't know how to calculate the accumulated worldwide productivity loss here, but it's undoubtedly quite substantial.
<br/><br/>
When you QWERTY, do you feel sometimes feelings of discomfort?
<br/>
Do you find your fingers juggling between characters?
<br/>
Do you suffer from some pain after typing a lot? (see [RSI][RSI])
<br/>

I know did and I didn't like that. But I didn't know what to do about it either until one year ago.
I just never found a good excuse to try to learn a new keyboard layout. In order to go for it I had to have a very good incentive.
<br/>
<br/>
I've always known there were more keyboards layouts besides being used [QWERTY][QWERTY].
I even knew that the 2nd most popular QWERTY alternative to QWERTY was [Dvorak][Dvorak].
Learning Dvorak seemed like the only valid alternative but it seemed an impossible endeavour. The learning curve appeared too steep.
<br/>
How could I do that without sacrificing my productivity for months?
<br/><br/>
## The When?
About one year ago I've coincidentally came across a relatively new keyboard layout called [Colemak][Colemak Site].
<br/><br/>
After doing some research about Colemak it felt like a different story, and the central reason is that
**Colemak has only 17 moved keys in comparison to QWERTY!**

That fact, at least I thought so, meant it will be much easier to learn Colemak.

From Colemak official site:
<br/>
_"Your fingers on QWERTY move 2.2x more than on Colemak.
<br/>
QWERTY has 16x more same hand row jumping than Colemak.
<br/>
There are 35x more words you can type using only the home row on Colemak."_

So I've decided I'd go for it. But I didn't want to go cold-turkey.
<br/>
I wanted a gradual process.
<br/>
I couldn't slow down significantly my productivity.
<br/><br/>
## The How?
The plan I came up with was to practice Colemak a couple of minutes on a daily basis and when I'll feel ready I'll do the swap.

I've Googled for a Typing Training app with Colemak support and found [Type Fu][Type Fu].
I highly recommend this app. I've started working through the lesson. Each lesson adds a new element to practice.

After a period of 9 months, practicing on-and-off it suddenly struck me that my QWERTY typing started to deteriorate.
The problem was that I wasn't yet fluent with Colemak either. You could imagine how frustrating this can feel.
It's like feeling in the midst of nowhere.

When that crisis popped-up I was in the middle of reading a book called [Ultralearning][Ultralearning Book Site] in my spare time.



## What about vim?
dot file


## Was it worth it?
macOS setting
brain flexibility
taking challenges
